# Security Policy

If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

## Reporting a vulnerability
 
Please **do not** open a public issue to report a security vulnerability, instead send
your report privately to the repository owner (you can find the email address in the git
commit history). This will help ensure that any vulnerabilities that are found can be
disclosed responsibly to any affected parties.
